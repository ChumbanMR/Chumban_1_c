The while loop in C is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. Hereâ€™s the basic syntax:

while (condition) {
    // Code to execute
}

Example 1: Simple Counter

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int count = 1;

    // While loop to print numbers 1 to 5
    while (count <= 5) {
        printf("Count: %d\n", count);
        count++;  // Increment the counter
    }

    return 0
